        <p class="BlogTitle">Being Creative On Linux From A Breakcore Producer's POV! Let's talk music production, image editing, and video editing...</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>In this blog post, I'll briefly discuss how I make music and other things on Linux. Music production on Linux is certainly not unheard of, and is becoming more and more common every day, but I hope by putting this blog post out there, I can provide some easy entrypoints for anyone thinking of making the switch, who has no idea about the world of music on Linux, or even the world of Linux in general.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>First of all, as a disclaimer, I'm no professional producer. I'm an amateur who almost exclusively just creates electronic music at a desk. I've worked in studios before, but never with Linux.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I did a sound engineering bachelors degree a few years ago - throughout, the topic of music production on Linux distros was never even touched upon. Quick side note - I find it very strange in retrospect that it wasn't. Universities use software that's costly and frankly, more advanced than necessary as a medium to convey the concepts being taught. You don't need to use a featureful version of Pro Tools to learn how to use a DAW, yanno. I suppose there's the argument that learning the industry standard software is beneficial, but that's really not a bottleneck. If you know one DAW, you can learn a reasonably similar one in a short period of time - similarly to programming languages.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>If you understand C++, you can pick up Rust reasonably easily, but that doesn't mean learning COBOL would be a breeze. Similarly, if you learn Ardour, you'd have a quite nice time learning Pro Tools, but ProTracker will feel alien to you. Not entirely sure what point I'm trying to make here.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>So, I mentioned Ardour. Let's shout out Ardour. I love Ardour. I use it for all my music production, and it's truly amazing. You can find more information about the project at <a class="TextLink" href="https://ardour.org/">ardour.org</a>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>Ardour is a completely open source and free DAW. Having used all of Logic, Pro Tools, Cubase, and Ableton in the past, I'll describe it with that context. For me, it lands somewhere between Pro Tools and Logic.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>It definitely doesn't come with any of the features in Ableton that makes you feel like you're using a DAW truly built for electronic music production and performance. It definitely has a feel more like Pro Tools, as I mentioned, and I believe the majority of the user base is likely doing predominately audio recording and live tracking of instruments. Don't take my opinion as fact though, this is just based off of feel and not backed up by any data at all.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>However, I'd say the workflow for producing music on Ardour is very similar to how you would on Logic - and I wouldn't describe that workflow as painful at all! In fact, it's a very popular one. The only things, in my eyes, that Ableton truly wins at are the library of sounds that come with Ableton, as well as the stock plugins. Obviously there's the whole "live" part, but that has no bearing on production in the DAW. Ableton I think is just really good at having instruments and plugins that sound great out of the box.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>That's not a dig at Ableton at all. I'm sure they have plenty of engineers working hard to make great sounding stuff. But it's incredibly pricey, and ships with the whole Live part, which I couldn't care less about. Also they have the Ableton Push, which I think is mad ugly. I've tried playing them before but always feels horrible. Maybe I'm a being a bit ignorant, since I'm definitely not the target audience. I don't know how many fingers and hands you'd need to effectively play breakcore on an Ableton Push :D though that's probably just a skill issue.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>Anyway, back to Ardour, and why it's perfect for what I need. I primarily make tracks with a mix of sampling, breakbeats, sample packs, and live recording. I live record my Yamaha Reface CS synthesizer, and often run it through my pedalboard. I have some guitars too, which I've yet to really use in STR1PE music, but I have plans to. I then obviously apply some processing on my audio, with plugins in Ardour. I don't use any MIDI instruments I don't sample.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>So, you see, my whole use case for a DAW is completely covered by Ardour. I record and sample live audio, then play it back via MIDI, as well as sampling audio I've downloaded from somewhere, keeping it in an audio track and manipulating it just like I would a normal audio clip.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For the recording, sampling, and playing back as MIDI, I use <a class="TextLink" href="https://samplv1.sourceforge.io/">samplv1</a>. For the sampling and manipulation of audio clips, these processes in Ardour are very friendly. You can stretch, reverse, pitch shift and change the gain of audio clips, among many other things, right in the timeline of the project.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>With these two things, I have practically all I need to produce music effectively in Ardour. And honestly, I only bothered finding out about samplv1 recently. Up until then, everything in my projects were just audio clips, no MIDI whatsoever. Completely insane, I know.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>My point being, I'd say my workflow is pretty common, and it's completely covered by Ardour with no problems. Sure, I'm sure there's some paid DAWs where the UI might be a touch nicer, or a touch more convenient, or slightly faster, but I'll make another argument from the world of Linux as to why that doesn't matter at all, making an allegory with the (by my standards) insane world of desktop environment customisation.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For those unfamiliar, in the world of Linux, there's large communities of people who customise their installation of their favourite distro, or even build a version of a distro themself, to have some sort of different UX. They'll also customise various GUI applications to have nice colour themes, custom background, custom applications that run on startup, etc etc. For an entrypoint into this world, see <a class="TextLink" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LinuxPorn/">r/LinuxPorn</a>.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For me, despite being an obvious Linux enthusiast, and spending my working hours working on a Linux distro, I really couldn't care less about this world of customisation. For me (and I acknowledge I don't represent more people than just myself), stuff like this is just a time sink. I log into my machine every day to get my work done as a software engineer. The bottleneck at my job, in terms of productivity, is never, ever, going to be the UX of my desktop environment. It's my brain - how quickly I can think of and execute ideas. So, having a fancy IDE with lots of addons doesn't really help me write code much faster (neovim user btw), because I'm waiting on my brain, not my fingers to type. So, investing time in minor performance improvements (in terms of UI navigation or whatever) is a bad time investment.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>So, to say it pretty plainly - when I'm using my Linux distro of choice, I don't care about the distro (I mean, I DO, but not in terms of customisation). I'm just using it to write code, which I can reasonably do on any distro, without losing much productivity or efficiency in terms of workflow.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I see DAWs as the same. I could care less about the DAW, as long as it's reasonably simple to use. What I care about, is the track behind the DAW. For me, the interface between me and my music should be as straightforward to use as possible, and require not much memorisation. When you use pretty minimal tools and software for things, I think you can become your most creative. Not to say Ardour is limited per say, but yanno what I mean.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>That brings me onto another point about why I like Ardour - and I'll use another allegory from the world of Linux.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>Command line utilities in Linux are supposed to do just one thing, and do them very well. When I say command line utilities, take a look at <a class="TextLink" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/">coreutils</a>, for example.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I really like this same ethos towards plugins. I say this, because I think Ardour comes with great stock plugins, some of which are quite expansive and featureful, but a lot are really quite simple. I think limiting yourself to really simple plugins is a great way to become a better producer. When you use elaborate plugins, with a built-in Sounds Good™️  guarantee, you begin to depend on them. Even though I have a sound engineering degree from times past, using Ardour and building more intricate sounds as the result of a signal chain through several simple plugins has made me a much better producer.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>Another good argument against the Do Everything™️  plugins and virtual instruments, asides from the argument of you relying on them, is that as they become more popular, you start to hear their use in music everywhere, leading to homogeneous and recognisable sonic profiles across like half of SoundCloud.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>A perfect example of what I mean by this, is the <a class="TextLink" href="https://xferrecords.com/products/serum-2">Serum</a> synthesizer. The Serum synth is an incredible wavetable synthesizer, which truly sounds amazing. So amazing, that it started a wave of music on SoundCloud that I hate, and dub Sound Designer Core™️ .</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>Basically, there was a massive uptick of people using tags like Sound Design and putting sound designer in their bio, and simply just releasing mediocre tracks using Serum, letting Serum do the work of making the track interesting, with the rest of the track being essentially, not memorable at all.. When I said Serum sounds amazing, I wasn't kidding. It really sounded so good to the point its widespread use bothered me. It's not interesting anymore when you hear it everywhere. I do have to make a disclaimer though that this kind of music isn't inherently bad, and there's artists in the genre that pull it off really well, and I like.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>So yeah, that's why I love Ardour. You can also install more plugins as *-lv2 debian packages, as well as in other ways. If you're thinking about making the switch to Linux, but you're kept on Windows due to your DAW only being available there, definitely download Ardour and give it a try before swapping over. Or if you're gutsy, just do it!</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For a DAW that is less suited to audio recording, and more suited to using purely virtual instruments and MIDI, you can try out <a class="TextLink" href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a>. <a class="TextLink" href="https://www.renoise.com/">Re-Noise</a> is also more suited to this, but is tracker-based, so the UI may not be what you're used to - I've considered switching to Re-Noise, and will give it a shot at some point - I've always found the tracker layout interesting. For something more similar to Ardour, consider <a class="TextLink" href="https://www.reaper.fm/">Reaper</a>. For simple audio recording for say, a podcast, you can use <a class="TextLink" href="https://obsproject.com/">OBS Studio</a>, or good ol' Audacity if you just want something simple.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For mixing, you can use <a class="TextLink" href="https://mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a>. I don't use this, as my DDJ is unsupported, unfortunately.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>So, for audio production, I've pretty much covered everything from my perspective.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I'll briefly touch on image and video editing too, since I do a bit of that. I can't speak anywhere near as extensively about it though.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For image editing I use the one, the only, <a class="TextLink" href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>. Not much to say here really, apart from that GIMP is absolutely awesome. It's probably takes the crown for best creative graphical application on Linux. If you use Photoshop and hate Adobe (as we all should) or simply want to switch to something else, move to GIMP! I can't really say of the differences between GIMP and Photoshop, but GIMP is no doubt a fully fledge image editing tool.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>For video editing I use KdenLive. I've only done very simple video editing with it, but the UI is nice, and for me, it's more than enough.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I spoke a bit earlier about Linux distros, so now I'll talk about what I run. I used to run regular ol' Ubuntu, and then install things like Ardour, but recently, I made the switch to <a class="TextLink" href="https://ubuntustudio.org/">Ubuntu Studio</a>. Ubuntu Studio is a flavour of Ubuntu that's tailored to creative work. It comes with all of the programs I mentioned above pre-installed, and is configured for better performance with this kind of work. I can't recommend it enough if you, like me, basically want to install a distro and not customise it as much as possible, and do creative work.</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I mentioned earlier, but I'll reiterate, if you want to make the switch from MacOS or Windows and have no experience on a Linux distro, I encourage you to try the programs you want to use on Linux on your current OS first. Make sure you like the alternatives before committing to them!</p>
    </div>
</div>

<div>
    <div>
        <p>I have to do a bit of Linux propaganda now. So obviously, you also will reclaim a bit of your digital freedom switching to any Linux distro... Open source alternatives to expensive, cruddy software... No more bloatware... No more spyware... No more endless popups on Windows... No more Gemini prompts... No more planned obsolescence... No more start menu being a React native application... You'll get many more years out of your hardware... The list goes on. I've tried to convince some of my music making friends to make the move to a Linux distro, and their concerns are always about having to learn a bunch of stuff. I understand the move to your first Linux distro requires a bit of learning, but I think the time investment is worth it to be liberated from shitware. The investment becomes more and more worthwhile the longer you've moved over, also. For example, over the years of becoming more and more comfortable on my Linux distro, I'm now soon going to get into self-hosting and homelab-ing. Kinda sick of streaming services so I think the first thing I'll do is host my own open source alternative to Spotify.</p>
